Decided to start completing the MOOC course DevOps with Docker because I'm planning to take the DevOps with Kubernetes in the future.

During the time of completing these assignments, the course instance is not available and therefore there is no course credits given.

Decided to publish these just for the funzies. Part 3 is only completed selectively.
